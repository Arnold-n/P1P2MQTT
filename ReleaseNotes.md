v0.9.17 (August 17, 2022)

- License change to Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license [(CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) (with exceptions)
- P1P2Serial, P1P2Monitor, P1P2Serial: software-oscilloscope timing info ("U1"/"U0") added, available via R topic (outputmode 0x1000)

v0.9.16 (August 11, 2022)

- P1P2Serial: #define S_TIMER switch to make TIMER0 use (for uptime_sec) optional
- P1P2Monitor: change upt\* from uint32_t to int32_t to catch uptime_sec returning -1

v0.9.15 (August 8, 2022)

- P1P2Serial: all LEDs on until P1/P2 bus traffic
- P1P2Monitor: extended verbosity command output with compile date/time
- P1P2-bridge-esp8266 (still end-of-life): extended verbosity command output with compile date/time, OTA hostname unique, few minor fixes

v0.9.14 (August 2, 2022)

- P1P2Serial: major rewrite of library, send and receive methodology spreads CPU load better over time, allowing 8MHz operation on ATmega328P. Old library version still available as fall-back (#define OLDP1P2LIB),
- P1P2Monitor: program supports generic parameter writing ('E' command) to packet types 0x35-0x3D. Other improvements include error and write throttling, error counters, EEPROM state maintenance, self-reset command, and communication via pseudo-packets: packets that look like P1/P2 packets, but which carry information generated by P1P2Monitor, and which just like real packets generate json/MQTT parameter packets and homeassistant MQTT discovery packets. Json/mqtt support has been removed from the ATmega code as it doesn't fit: it is better handled on a separate CPU (such as the ESP8266),
- P1P2-bridge-esp8266: code has been extended with lots of improvements: telnet, schedule decoding, field setting decoding, boot process analysis, self-reset and ATmega-reset, ATmega-AVRISP, improved OTA, binary output over MQTT, configurable output modes ('J' command), configurable output filter ('S' command), home assistant MQTT discovery, state maintenance in flash and more. P1P2-bridge-esp8266 is becoming too big for an ESP8266 (schedule decoding is disabled for that reason). This is the last version of P1P2-bridge-esp8266, please don't use it for further develoment. It will be replaced by P1P2MQTT.
- P1P2MQTT: will replace P1P2-bridge-esp8266, work-in-progress, waiting for release
