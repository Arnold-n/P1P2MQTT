## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project are very welcome: feedback, P1/P2 bus logs, documentation, reverse engineering notes, or code. Extending support to other models depends on you, the users.

Code contributions are to be done under the project license, which is the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license [(CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) with additional exceptions as indicated in [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/Arnold-n/P1P2MQTT/blob/main/LICENSE).

Additionally, upon contributing any code you are herewith asked and deemed to waive the NoDerivatives limitation towards the project and its users, to enable further development of the project.

Also, upon contributing any code you are herewith asked and deemed to waive the NonCommercial and NoDerivatives limitations towards the project owner. This makes it possible for me to make and sell (factory-made) P1P2-ESP-Interfaces and other hardware for this project. It is more material- and cost-efficient if these boards are made centrally, and to continue this project (I have invested a lot of time and failed experiments in making small, efficient, reliable circuitry).
