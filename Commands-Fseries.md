# Commands for Daikin F-series (VRV / Sky air) models

Some of the Daikin F-series models communicate systems parameters between the main controller and auxiliary controller in packet types 30-3F. Most intersting are packet type 38 (for FDY125LV1, FXMQ200PWM, and several others) or 3B (for FDYQ180MV1).

Some of these parameters can be changed, one at a time, by P1P2Monitor - when acting as an auxiliary controller (L1 mode) - using the P1P2Monitor command 'F'. In a future release these commands will be automatically generated by the ESP interacting with Home Assistant.

The F command format is
`F <packet-type> <payload-index> <new-value>`
with packet-type and new-value hexadecimal, and payload-index in decimal format. If you hate spaces, you may concatenate these using a 2-char packet-type and 2-byte parameter number: `F38 0 1` is equivelant to `F380001`.

Some example parameters and commands (these may or may not work on other models):

## FDYL125LV1, FXMQ200PWM, some other models

As an example, payload byte 0 in packet type 38 is used for switching cooling/heating off.
