# Commands for Daikin F-series (VRV / Sky air) models

Some of the Daikin F-series models communicate systems parameters between the main controller and auxiliary controller in packet types 30-3F. Most interesting are packet type 38 (for FDY125LV1, FXMQ200PWM, and several others) or 3B (for FDYQ180MV1).

## Major version or major design

Daikin seems to identify its models by "major version" or "major design (change/category)" by the first letter after the capacity identifer: for example FDY125LV1 is major version L, FXMQ200PWM is major version P. We currently think that the major version determines the protocol data format; although for major version L there are at least two different formats.

## Command format

Some of these parameters can be changed, one at a time, by P1P2Monitor - when acting as an auxiliary controller (L1 mode) - using the P1P2Monitor command 'F'. In a future release these commands will be automatically generated by the ESP interacting with Home Assistant.

The F command format is
`F <packet-type> <payload-index> <new-value>`
with packet-type and new-value hexadecimal, and payload-index in decimal format. If you hate spaces, you may concatenate these using a 2-char packet-type and 2-byte parameter number: `F38 0 1` is equivelant to `F380001`.

Please pause for a few seconds between commands as commands are not yet buffered.

Some example parameters and commands (these may or may not work on other models) are given below. As an example, the first command in each table shows how to change payload byte 0 in packet type 38 or 3B for switching cooling/heating off.

## For major version B, C, L: FBQ-B, ADEQ-B2VEB, FBQ-C7VEB, FDY-LV1, perhaps FBQ-B7V1

THe commands are the same as for major version L, P, A, even though the protocol data format is slightly different.

## For major version L, P, A: FXMQ-PAVE, FXMQ-PWM, FDYQN-LAV1, perhaps FBA-A9

| `F380001`    | to switch on (alternative without spaces)
| `F 38 0 0`   | to switch off
| `F 38 1 61`  | to set heating mode
| `F 38 1 62`  | to set cooling mode
| `F 38 1 63`  | to set auto mode
| `F 38 1 67`  | to set dry mode
| `F 38 1 60`  | to set fan-only mode
| `F 38 2 17`  | to set the setpoint to 0x17 = 23C (cooling mode)
| `F 38 2 19`  | to set the setpoint to 0x19 = 25C
| `F 38 4 11`  | to set the fanmode to low         (cooling mode)

## For major version M: FDYQ-MV, possibly others

As an example, payload byte 0 in packet type 3B is used for switching cooling/heating off.

| `F 3B 1 62`  | to set cooling mode
| `F 3B 1 63`  | to set auto mode
| `F 3B 1 67`  | to set dry mode
| `F 3B 1 60`  | to set fan-only mode
| `F 3B 2 17`  | to set the setpoint to 0x17 = 23C (cooling mode)
| `F 3B 2 19`  | to set the setpoint to 0x19 = 25C
| `F 3B 4 11`  | to set the fanmode to low         (cooling mode)

| `F 3B 6 17`  | to set the setpoint to 0x17 = 23C (heating mode)
| `F 3B 6 19`  | to set the setpoint to 0x19 = 25C
| `F 3B 8 11`  | to set the fanmode to low         (heating mode)

| `F 3B 16 ??` | (not sure yet, active hvac zones related)
| `F 3B 17 ??` | (not sure yet, target fan mode related)
