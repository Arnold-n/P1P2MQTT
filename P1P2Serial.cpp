 *
 * Version history
 * 20220511 v0.9.12 various minor bug fixes
 * 20200109 v0.9.11 allow short pauses between bytes within a packet (for KLIC-DA device, to avoid detecting each byte as individual packet)
 * 20190914 v0.9.10 upon bus collision detection, write buffer is emptied
 * 20190914 v0.9.9 Added writeready()
 * 20190908 v0.9.8 Removed EOP signal in errorbuf results returned by readpacket(); as of now errorbuf contains only real error flags
 * 20190831 v0.9.7 Switch from TIMER0 to TIMER2 to avoid interference with millis() and readBytesUntil(), reduced RX_BUFFER_SIZE to 50
 * 20190824 v0.9.6 Added packetavailable()
 * 20190820 v0.9.5 Changed delay behaviour, timeout added
 * 20190817 v0.9.4 Clean up, bug fixes, improved ms counter, prescaler reset added, time measurement changed, delta/error reporting separated
 * 20190505 v0.9.3 Changed error handling and corrected deltabuf type in readpacket
 * 20190428 v0.9.2 Added setEcho(b), readpacket() and writepacket()
 * 20190409 v0.9.1 Improved setDelay()
 * 20190407 v0.9.0 Improved reading, writing, and meta-data; added support for timed writings and collision detection; added stand-alone hardware-debug mode
 * 20190303 v0.0.1 initial release; support for raw monitoring and hex monitoring

// Input parameter: 0 <= t <= 65535
// This sets delay for next byte (and next byte only) when it is added to the transmission buffer.
// The writing of the next byte to be added to the queue will be delayed until (<= v0.9.4: at least; >= v0.9.5: exactly) t milliseconds silence
//                since last falling edge of start bit has been detected. (v0.9.5:) In addition, writing will follow in case of a timeout situation.
// This means that a delay is introduced since the byte last read, or,
// as we also read back sent data (also for the purpose of verification), since the byte last written.
// If a byte is added to the queue during a silence, the past silence will also be taken into account.
// (<=v0.9.4:) If a byte is added with a setDelay which is shorter than the past silence, transmission will start immediately.
// (>=v0.9.5:) If the past silence is more that t ms, but less than the timeout value, writing will be delayed until either one of the following 2 conditions is met:
//                1) a new byte is received, after which a new pause will be clocked, or
//                2) no new byte is received, but the total pause is or becomes longer than the value set with setDelayTimeout(t)
//                The reason for this change in behaviour is to prevent bus collissions when writing a packet near the end of a pause.
// If the value used as delay timeout is equal to or lower than the delay value, the writing behaviour of >=v0.9.5 equals the behaviour of library version <=v0.9.4
// It is advised to call setDelaytimeout(t) with a value that is larger than the total cycle time of the P1P2 bus behaviour.
// For many products the cycle repeats every 0.8..2s, so a setDelaytimeout(2500) would be appropriate. This is also the default value.
// For some products the cycle time can be larger (15s or so), and a setDelaytimeout(20000) might be appropriate.
// If setDelay(0) is called, or setDelay() is not called, there is no delay at all when writing. Writing will start immediately
//                as soon as a byte is written to the write buffer, if there was no bus action, or when the previous byte write is ready.
// If setDelay(1) is called, a delay of 1.13 ms (11 bits, 1 byte) is set after the last start bit falling edge,
//                so writing is done exactly after the last written or read byte.
//                This may be useful for interfacing according to the HBS timing protocol
//                Note that if setDelay(1) is called when the bus is written to by another device, a bus collision will occur if writing by the other device also continues
//                Use of setDelay(1) is therefore discouraged
//                Note that SetDelay is not (yet) suited for proper HBS timing, as HBS timing measures pauses from the end of the stop bit
//                Timing on the P1P2 bus is not so critical and SetDelay works fine for the P1P2 bus.
// If setDelay (t) is called with 2 <= t <= 65535, a delay of t ms is set.
// It is recommended to NOT use setDelay(0) or setDelay(1), unless really needed, because of the risk of bus collision.
